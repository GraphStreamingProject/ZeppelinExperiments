Kron17 should give us examples of dense graphs with many connected components.
If we don't get good results, here are some ideas for other types of graphs.

---------- Manual generation ----------
SPARSE MANY CCs
1. Erdos-Renyi with ultra-low probability

SPARSE FEW CCs
1. Erdos-Renyi with low probability

DENSE FEW CCs
1. Kron17
2. Erdos-Renyi with high probability

DENSE MANY CCs
1. Union many smaller high-probability Erdos-Renyi graphs
2. Coprime graph using small primes, union larger primes
